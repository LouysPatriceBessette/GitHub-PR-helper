# GitHub-PR-helper
Deploys all threads (loads all hidden - adds numbers and a context menu)

Works great in Tampermonkey (https://www.tampermonkey.net/) and Chrome (not tested in any other way yet).

How add this script to your installed Tampermonkey browser extension: https://www.tampermonkey.net/faq.php#Q102  
Another way to add the script quickly is importing the .zip file. How to? https://www.tampermonkey.net/faq.php#Q106

It will expand those weirdly hiddens (like if it was useful):

And you wil have numbers for each.      
Right-clicking the number gives a context menu from which you can copy the thread specific url or the source file path to clipboard.  
Use your keyboard number keys to scroll to a specific thread number... Like hit 12!
